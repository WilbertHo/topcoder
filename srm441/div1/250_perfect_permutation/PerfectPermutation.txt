PROBLEM STATEMENT
A permutation A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1] is a sequence containing each integer between 0 and N-1, inclusive, exactly once.  Each permutation A of length N has a corresponding child array B of the same length, where B is defined as follows:


B[0] = 0
B[i] = A[B[i-1]], for every i between 1 and N-1, inclusive.


A permutation is considered perfect if its child array is also a permutation.

Below are given all permutations for N=3 with their child arrays. Note that for two of these permutations ({1, 2, 0} and {2, 0, 1}) the child array is also a permutation, so these two permutations are perfect.


Permutation		Child array
{0, 1, 2}		{0, 0, 0}
{0, 2, 1}		{0, 0, 0}
{1, 0, 2}		{0, 1, 0}
{1, 2, 0}		{0, 1, 2}
{2, 0, 1}		{0, 2, 1}
{2, 1, 0}		{0, 2, 0}


You are given a tuple (integer) P containing a permutation of length N.  Find a perfect permutation Q of the same length such that the difference between P and Q is as small as possible, and return this difference.  The difference between P and Q is the number of indices i for which P[i] and Q[i] are different.

DEFINITION
Class:PerfectPermutation
Method:reorder
Parameters:tuple (integer)
Returns:integer
Method signature:def reorder(self, P):


CONSTRAINTS
-P will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-P will contain each integer between 0 and N-1, inclusive, exactly once, where N is the number of elements in P.


EXAMPLES

0)
{2, 0, 1}

Returns: 0

P is a perfect permutation, so we can use the same permutation for Q.  The difference is then 0 because P and Q are the same.

1)
{2, 0, 1, 4, 3}

Returns: 2

Q might be {2, 0, 3, 4, 1}.

2)
{2, 3, 0, 1}

Returns: 2

Q might be {1, 3, 0, 2}.

3)
{0, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4}

Returns: 3



4)
{4, 2, 6, 0, 3, 5, 9, 7, 8, 1}

Returns: 5
